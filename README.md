# python-Spelling-Rectification
This is a program in python which makes use of the textBlob and python SpellChecker libraries to rectify spelling mistakes. The program reads in a sample text (in this case, the very large text of 'Moby Dick') and attempts to find all misspelled words and outputs their suggested correct alternatives using methods like Levenshtein distance.
